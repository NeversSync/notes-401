## User Authourization
- check may 2nd in class notes in auth.js and user.js, ect.
- are you who you say you are?
- if you are, what are you allowed to do/see?
- place tokens either in header or in query string.
- theoretically, because browsers cache your browser history, storing it in query string isnt as secure as the header
- SSL 
    - encryption of the body of what is being sent in the request.
- Bcrypt npm package creates hashes out of text passwords, also has methods like compare to compare passwords and check that they are the same. 
- export ensure auth schema to app.js and use it as first function in the routes to keep people from getting through without authorization.
