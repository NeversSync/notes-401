## things that make coding hard:
- unfamiliar content
- taking on too much at one time
- too long without feedback, making sure it works.
- can't understand error, or no error.
- don't understand how something is working
- don't understand what something you are using is supposed to do
- most challlegne comes from things getting hard to think about. 
- cognitive load- wikipeida. refers to total amount of mental effor being used. 
- What to do? Adopt processes, practices and patterns that reduce cognitive load. optimize the signal-to-noise ratio. secret weapon is modularity.
- reduce cycle time and maximize feedback loop.

## TDD
- red 
  - write test to fail
- green
  - make work in simplest way you think of
- refactor

- ES6 default argument
  - function something(argument = something) {};
  - will default arugment to something unless provided.

- Require ordering:
  - asserts/vendors above local files you wrote and are requiring

  ### process
  - unit of execution controlled by the operating system
    - cpu time
    - memory space
    - stdin/stdout/stderr all processes have these. 
    - TCP - transmission communication protocol. sends information between two sockets on a network.
